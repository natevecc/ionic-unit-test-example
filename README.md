# Ionic Unit Test Example

An example app that shows how to use karma inside an ionic 2 project

## Usage

Requires ionic 2 and gulp installed globally: `npm install -g ionic@beta gulp`

Simply download or clone this repo, run `npm install` then you can run `gulp test` to run the unit tests once. `gulp test:watch` puts it in TDD mode.
You could use this as a starter if you so desired.
